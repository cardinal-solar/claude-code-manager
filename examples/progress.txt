## 2026-02-03T22:35:42.134Z - US-001
- Created a TypeScript greeting function that accepts a name parameter and returns a personalized greeting message. The function is properly exported and includes JSDoc documentation for better developer experience.
- Files changed: greeting.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Simple user stories with clear acceptance criteria are straightforward to implement
  - TypeScript functions benefit from explicit type annotations for parameters and return types
  - JSDoc comments improve code documentation and IDE intelligence
  - Export keyword at function declaration makes the function immediately available for module imports

## 2026-02-03T22:36:55.842Z - US-002
- Successfully implemented a greeting function that includes current ISO 8601 timestamp. Created greeting.ts with greet() and getCurrentTimestamp() functions, along with comprehensive test suite. All tests pass and acceptance criteria are met.
- Files changed: greeting.ts, greeting.test.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ) is the standard for timestamps in JavaScript using toISOString()
  - Consistent format ensures predictable parsing and display across different systems and timezones
  - The toISOString() method always returns UTC time (Z suffix) which avoids timezone confusion
  - Test suite should verify not just format but also that timestamp reflects current time
